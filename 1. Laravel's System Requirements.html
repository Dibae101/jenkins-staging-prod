<p>For you to develop Laravel applications on your computer, you need to have the following programs installed:</p><ul><li><p>PHP: The programming language that Laravel is built on,</p></li><li><p>Any relational database of your choice but MySQL is used in this course,</p></li><li><p>Composer which is a dependencies manager for PHP applications.</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/homestead" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel Homestead</a> is good for this as it gives you everything you need to develop any PHP application out of the box. But it is a bit tricky to get started with if you are new to developing PHP/Laravel applications.</p><p>If you want a quick start, you may consider <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">XAMPP</a> which is the program used in this course. There are other options but I think any of these is good enough to get started with.</p><p>If you go with XAMPP, you will need to install <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Composer</a> separately on your machine. Click "<a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Getting Started</a>" for the installation process.</p>
